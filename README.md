A Linux based website terminal only using static & vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

**UNDERDEVELOPMENT: THERE IS STILL MORE TO BE ADDED AND THIS PROJECT IS NOT IN A FINISHED STATE**

## Features

- Custom commands (like help, about, terminal)
- Linux imported commands (echo, history)
- Press Arrowup to use previous command like an actual terminal

## Inspriation

This project was first started in July 2022 inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtYby2QN0kQ">This ForrestKnight Video</a>.

I then used a similar website like this by <a href="www.https://craigfeldman.com/">Craig feldman</a> for some concept ideas (such as banner prompt text and a command on how it was made)
